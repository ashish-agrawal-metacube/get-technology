# GET Technology Guidelines

This document describes the proposed technology guidelines in Graduate Engineering Trainee (GET) Project at metacube.

If you have ***any question*** please [***ask***](https://github.com/dwyl/get-technology/issues).

## Overview
This document is the guide we use for developing apps in GET project. We encourage you to set up one that works for your own team. Feel free to peruse.

Don't violate a guideline without a good reason. A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

Feel free to [***contribute***](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/#contributing).

### Dependencies <small>(*technologies we trust*)</small>
Some general guidelines for technologies

+ [**ruby**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - A dynamic, open source programming language with a focus on simplicity and productivity. It has an elegant syntax that is natural to read and easy to write.
+ [**Ruby on Rails**](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) - Ruby on Rails makes it much easier and more fun. It includes everything you need to build fantastic applications.
+ [**AngularJS**](https://angularjs.org/) - AngularJS lets you write client-side web applications as if you had a smarter browser. It automatically synchronizes data from your UI (view) with your JavaScript objects (model) through 2-way data binding.
+ [**Bootstrap**](http://getbootstrap.com) - The most popular HTML, CSS, and JavaScript framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. Bootstrap is a sleek, intuitive, and powerful front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
+ [**MySQL**](http://www.mysql.com/) - the most widely used open-source RDBMS.
+ [**Heroku**](http://www.heroku.com) - Heroku is a cloud Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages. It has Powerful platform, unparalleled ecosystem. Itâ€™s one of the best platform for building with modern architectures, innovating quickly, and scaling precisely to meet demand.

### Development Dependencies

These are few modules or app in our development toolchain:

+ [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) is a source code editor. A hackable text editor for the 21st Century.
+ [**Github**](http://github.com) for Source Code Management.
+ [**rspec**](http://rspec.info) for testing: 
+ [**Travis-CI**](https://travis-ci.org/) - We *recommend* travis-ci for Continuous Integration (CI). Checkout the beginners [guide](https://github.com/gbohra/get-technology/tree/master/travis)
+ [**CodeClimate**](https://codeclimate.com/) for tracking code quality.
+ [**CodeCov**](https://codecov.io/) for *detailed* test/code coverage stats.
+ [**YARD**](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md) for code comment guidelines and document generation.

### Sample Application
The intent of this repository is to building maintainable ruby on rails applications. This example is used in GET program.

Note: This [**repository**](github) is a work in progress.

### Project Management
[**Pivotal tracker**](http://www.pivotaltracker.com) - Simple, effective project management for agile teams. It's agile project management and collaboration tool.
