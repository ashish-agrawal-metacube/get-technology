# GET Technology Guidelines

This document describes the proposed technology guidelines in Graduate Engineering Trainee Project.

If you have ***any questions*** please
[***ask***](https://github.com/dwyl/get-technology-guidelines/issues)

## Overview
This document is the guide we use for developing apps in GET project. We encourage you to set up one that works for your own team. Feel free to peruse.

Don't violate a guideline without a good reason. A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

+ **simplecov** for Code Coverage. [**help**](https://github.com/gbohra/get-technology-guidelines/blob/master/learn-simplecov/)
+ **Pre-commit** for ensuring all commits pass strict quality checks before being pushed to GitHub. [**help**](https://github.com/gbohra/get-technology-guidelines/blob/master/learn-pre-commit/)
+ [**CodeClimate**](https://codeclimate.com/) for tracking code quality.
+ [**CodeCov**](https://codecov.io/) for *detailed* test/code coverage stats.
+ [**YARD**](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/yard/file/docs/GettingStarted.md) for code comment guidelines and document generation.
